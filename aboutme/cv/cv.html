		<h2>Summary</h2>
		
		<p>
			I'm Java Developer with strong academic background, diverse experience and excellent computer skills. I'm 
			hungry for knowledge and challenges. So there are gaps in my work experience. Let me clarify them.
		
		<p>
			From <i>December 2013</i> till <i>December 2014</i> I served in Armed Forces of Belarus.

		<p>
			From <i>November 2017</i> till <i>June 2018</i> I tried to get rid of office job and start my career as 
			freelancer. Also, I attempted to write paid articles on Java, Linux, security. But without luck.

		<p>
			I improved my programming skills every day. I concentrated not only on Java but on Python as well. Another 
			area of my interests was abandoned software. I liked to hack it. I thought that learning the history of 
			computer science had helped me to understand modern technologies at theirs bases. I wrote dozens of free 
			articles. Most of them are located on <a href="http://flaz14.github.io/">this website</a>, some of them are 
			published in <a href="http://dgmag.in/">Downgrade e-journal</a>.

		<p>
			I'm a Linux geek. I like to customize my working environment and take the utmost of custom shell 
			improvements, AppArmor, etc.

		<p>
			In addition to that I like to read books and visit libraries. I like not only read but collect good 
			technical stuff. When I see nice article on Internet I save it to my computer. Most of the material is 
			categorized and reside in the appropriate folders. Sometimes I download entire websites to my PC.

		<p>
			In my spare time I do physical training. I like walking. I go everywhere: in parks, in the center of the 
			city and through the countryside. I like to repair old things also.

		<p>
			I can touch type. I like pure strict HTML. And I'm a fan of Unicode.

						I worked on Power Supply Company site - typical corporate system (cutting-edge technologies as 
						well as legacy stuff) based on micro-services architecture.

					<p>
						I was responsible for development of REST APIs using Spring, Jersey, etc. I made a lot of 
						testing: not only Unit testing but Integration and Functional as well (using frameworks such as 
						JBehave and Selenium).

					<p>
						When on the project I was recognized as Code Review Monster by the team. I reviewed thousands 
						lines of code and wrote hundreds of useful comments.

					<p>
						Also, I automated tedious job (for example, generating a bunch of SQL queries based on the data 
						from Excel workbook) as much as possible with aid of Python.

					<p>
						The last but not least thing was so called "Jenkins Duty". It was a kind of DevOps activity. 
						When on the duty I maintained development environment so our CI/CD process had ran smoothly and 
						effectively. I gained a huge amount of Linux, networking and general trouble-shooting skills.
