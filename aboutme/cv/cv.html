						Aspose.Words for Java is a feature-rich API for processing of all formats supported by Microsoft Word. I was responsible for maintaining the library: bug fixing, performance tuning, customer support.

					<p>
						My job was quite specific: 90% of the tasks were not "googleable". E.g. there were not typical solutions that could be found on the Internet. In many cases I dealt with mathematics, analyzed binary files in hex-editor, used exotic debugging tools, read a lof of specifications.

						The back-end part of application was not considered as high-loaded service. But minimalism and 
						stability were in focus (so the CRM could run on low-end hardware).

						I worked on Power Supply Company site - typical corporate system (cutting-edge technologies as

					<p>
						I was responsible for development of REST APIs using Spring, Jersey, etc. I made a lot of 
						testing: not only Unit testing but Integration and Functional as well (using frameworks such as 
						JBehave and Selenium).

					<p>
						When on the project I was recognized as Code Review Monster by the team. I reviewed thousands 
						lines of code and wrote hundreds of useful comments.

					<p>
						Also, I automated tedious job (for example, generating a bunch of SQL queries based on the data 
						from Excel workbook) as much as possible with aid of Python.

					<p>
						The last but not least thing was so called "Jenkins Duty". It was a kind of DevOps activity. 
						When on the duty I maintained development environment so our CI/CD process had ran smoothly and 
						effectively. I gained a huge amount of Linux, networking and general trouble-shooting skills.

						HyperGraphDB is a general purpose, open-source data storage mechanism based on a powerful

						Our department served approximately 300 computers (desktop PCs, servers, thin clients etc).

						I was responsible for installing software, updating software, diagnostics and repairing software 
						failures. And I was responsible for execution requests for help/assistance from user's side. I 
						communicated a lot with users from different departments.

					<p>
						My greatest achievement was database restoration. There was Apache Derby database which 
						contained tax declarations. One part I restored by hand using XML export/import functionality of 
						EDeclaration software. For renewal of other part I developed specific Java program.

		<h2>Out-of-Job Activities</h2>
		
		<p>
			From <i>December 2013</i> till <i>December 2014</i> I served in Armed Forces of Belarus.

		<p>
			From <i>November 2017</i> till <i>June 2018</i> I tried to get rid of office job and start my career as 
			freelancer. Also, I attempted to write paid articles on Java, Linux, security. But without luck.

		<p>
			I improve my programming skills every day. I concentrate not only on Java but on Python as well. Another 
			area of my interests is abandoned software. I like to hack it. I think that learning the history of 
			computer science helps me to understand modern technologies at theirs bases. I've wrote dozens of free 
			articles. Most of them are located on <a href="http://flaz14.github.io/">this website</a>, some of them are 
			published in <a href="http://dgmag.in/">Downgrade e-journal</a>.

		<p>
			I'm a Linux geek. I like to customize my working environment and take the utmost of custom shell 
			improvements, AppArmor, etc.

		<p>
			In addition to that I like to read books and visit libraries. I like not only read but collect good 
			technical stuff. When I see nice article on Internet I save it to my computer. Most of the material is 
			categorized and reside in the appropriate folders. Sometimes I download entire websites to my PC.

		<p>
			In my spare time I do physical training. I like walking. I go everywhere: in parks, in the center of the 
			city and through the countryside. I like to repair old things also.

		<p>
			I can touch type. I like pure strict HTML. And I'm a fan of Unicode.
