							Obstacles with setting up environment variables and aliases

				<h3>[2015]</h3>

				<h2>Goal</h2>
				
				<p>
					Set custom environment variables and aliases of console commands for specific user.
			
				<h2>Deal with environment variables</h2>

				<p>
					Put definitions of environment variables into <i>~/.profile</i>. For example:
<pre>
# ~/.profile: executed by the command interpreter for login shells.
# This file is not read by bash(1), if ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login
# exists.
...
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk1.8.0_40
...
</pre>

				<h2>Deal with aliases</h4>
				
				<p>
					Create <i>~/.bashrc</i> if it doesn't exist and put definitions of aliases into it. For example:
<pre>
alias tclear='setterm -reset'
alias ll='ls -alh'
</pre>

				<h2>Where are obstacles?</h2>
				
				<p>
					Putting definitions of environment variables into <i>~/.bashrc</i> enables them only in a shell. 
					Thus if program was ran from terminal it can access environment variables. If program was ran from 
					desktop shortcut it can not discover environment variables.
					
				<p>
					Aliases are used only from terminal. So they should be declared in <i>~/.bashrc</i> (or 
					<i>~/.bash_aliases</i> depending on a distro). Putting aliases into <i>~/.profile</i> makes them 
					unaccessible for <code>bash</code> commands.
					
				</p>
					Competent explanation is in
					<a href="http://superuser.com/a/183980">
						the answer for question "Difference between .bashrc and .bash_profile"
					</a>.
