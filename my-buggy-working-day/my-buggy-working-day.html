				<p>
					<i>
						This little poem was inspired by my first job in outsourcing. Those days are so far away...<br>
						Many great thanks to <strong>Sviatlana B.</strong>, the English teacher who helped me to polish 
						the poem!

				<p>
					I arrived at work at nine,<br>
					I was feeling really fine.<br> 
					I updated, started build<br>
					And came back to LinuxGeek.<br>

				<p>
					Half an hour wasted. "Blame!<br>
					Let's return to work again!"<br>
					Then I read in my console:<br>
					"Oh my God, the build is broken!"<br>

				<p>
					"Make it working? No, not now.<br>
					I have the book for the next hour.<br>
					I will read and will grow up!"<br>
					But the teamlead gave me bug.<br>

				<p>
					"Bug's not critical... Okay.<br>
					Will be fixed." - as I would say.<br>
					Then I imitated my work.<br>
					And left my bug untouched at all.<br>

				<p>
					I again surfed the Inet<br>
					And again I searched the Web<br>
					"How to do?" and "how to be?"<br>
					But my bug was still on me.<br>

				<p>
					Nothing done and nothing changed,<br>
					It did seem a little strange.<br>
					Oh, I wasted lots of time.<br>
					The teamleader asked me now:<br>

				<p>
					"What was done and will be done?"<br>
					"How to answer?.. All is fine!<br>
					I'm in progress" - then I said.<br>
					- "Good, then finish it today."<br>

				<p>
					Kitchen noise attracted me<br>
					And I went away from here...<br>
					I returned to my workplace,<br>
					Hour wasted. "What's a mess?!!"<br>

				<p>
					"One and one - it will be two,<br>
					Half an hour plussing too,<br>
					One for reading, one for tea,<br>
					But my bug is still on me."<br>

				<p>
					"What do to and how to do?<br>
					How to be in my job good?<br>
					How to deal with painful bugs?<br>
					Maybe ask my team at once?<br>

				<p>
					Maybe they will take my pain?<br>
					And for all it will be gain.<br>
					I keep silent, I don't know<br>
					How to say and ask at all.<br>
					How to say "Let's do my work.<br>
					Help me, please! I'm in deadlock!!!"<br>

				<p>
					Day was over. I went home.<br>
					Hope tomorrow it is done.<br>
